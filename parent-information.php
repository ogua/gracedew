                        <b>Homework</b><br>
                        Our staff is encouraged to provide
                        homework experiences for our students at a manageable level appropriate to
                        their age level. Teachers monitor the
                        amount of homework asked of the
                        students and welcome your comments
                        as to how much time your child spends
                        completing at-home assignments.
                        Parents must sign after the completion
                        of each homework before the child
                        submits itto school. <br>

                        Homework can mean reading, project
                        work and review of concepts or
                        completion of work assigned during
                        class. There are many ways parents can
                        help with homework. These include:

                        <ul>
                            <li> Providing a quiet, regular place to
                            work. </li>

                            <li> Helping their children organise their
                            time for assignments. </li>

                            <li> Being the “audience” for reading
                                practice, spelling and mathematics
                            drills. </li>

                            <li> Providing information and
                            knowledge for projects. </li>

                        </ul>

                        The support and interest of parents will
                        have a large influence on students’
                        attitudes toward homework. If you have
                        any questions about the assignments
                        your children bring home, please do not
                        hesitate to bring this to management's
                        attention and we shall have you talk to
                        theirteachers.
