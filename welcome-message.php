                <h1 class="mb-4 text-center">Our Welcome message</h1>
                <p>We are delighted that you have enrolled
                    your precious child with us here at
                    Gracedew International School. We are
                    committed to making your child's
                    transition from home to school as easy
                as possible..</p>
                <p class="mb-4">To provide an efficient service we ask
                    that all parents adhere to the following: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Parents are asked to observe the
                            school opening and closing hours of
                            7.00 am till 4.00 pm. The school gate
                            closes at exactly 8am and no child
                            will be allowed in after the gate is
                            closed. Late pickups warrant a
                            penalty of GHc20.00 per hour, or part
                        thereof. </li>

                        <li> For safety reasons, parents or
                            guardians are asked to accompany
                            their children to and from the school
                            and hand them directly to a staff
                            member. If a child is being picked up
                            by anyone other than a parent or
                        guardian, the staff must be notified. </li>

                        <li> Parents must notify the school
                            before 7:30 am if their ward will be
                            late. Note that “traffic” is not an
                        excuse. </li>

                        <li> Parents should provide water and
                        fruit for their wards. </li>

                        <li> Children should not bring in their
                        toys. </li>

                        <li> All prescribed uniforms, sweaters,
                            bags and lunch boxes should be
                            clearly labelled with the child's
                        name. </li>

                        <li> Parents must pay the fees in full, or
                            at least half of the fees before the
                            start of every term. The remaining
                            balance of the term’s fees must be
                        paid at the end of the same month. </li>

                        <li>Parents must provide two house
                            clothes and a pair of sandals that will
                            be kept in the school for pupils in
                            créche. On Thursday, the clothes,
                            together with the PE attire, will be
                            taken home for washing if they are
                        dirty. </li>

                        <li> If you have any questions about any
                            staff member, our headmaster will
                            be glad to discuss them with you in
                        the strictest of confidence. </li>

                        <li> If a child is unwell, he or she should
                        stay home. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">Finally, we welcome your child and hope
                    he or she will blossom, grow, gain
                    confidence, strengthen their self-
                    esteem and independence and above all,
                have fun and enjoy the experience..</p>
