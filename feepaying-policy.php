                       <b> Overview </b> <br>

                        Gracedew International school opens
                        five days a week, Monday to Friday. <br>

                        Our daily opening times are 7am - 4pm.
                        Each year parents are notified of planned
                        closures at the start of the term.

                    </p>

                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">

                        <b>Fees</b> <br>

                        <ul>

                        <li> A copy of our current fees can
                        also be obtained from the
                        office.</li>

                        <li> In the event of a change in our
                        fees, we will communicate this
                        to parents with a month's
                        notice.</li>

                    </ul>

                </p>

                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">

                       <b> Payment of Fees </b> <br>

                        <ul>
                        <li> Parents must pay at least half
                        of the fees before the start of
                        every term. If the parent is
                        unable to pay the fees in full,
                        the remaining balance of the
                        fees must be paid at the end of
                        the same month. </li>

                        <li> Fees can be paid by making a
                        direct deposit in the school's
                        bank account. </li>

                        <li> The school does not provide
                        credit. </li>

                        <li> All activities and sections
                        booked must be paid for,
                        whether your child attends or
                        not. </li>

                    </ul>

                        <b>Please note:</b> <br>

                        Failure to adhere to the Fee Paying Policy
                        may result in the Management asking
                        you to withdraw your child from the
                        service [with due notice). In this event,
                        your place will be offered to the next child
                        on the waiting list. Should you anticipate
                        any difficulty adhering to the Fee Paying
                        Policy, we would encourage you to
                        contact the Director at the earliest
                        opportunity to set up a meeting for
                        discussion. <br>

                        Gracedew International School will
                        refuse admission to a child whose sibling
                        or any family was previously enrolled and
                        left an outstanding bill.

                        Cultural and educational learning
                        experiences are scheduled during the
                        school year. Learning experiences are
                        planned to enhance your child's
                        educational process and must be
                        relevant to what is being studied.

                        During registration, an activity fee is paid
                        to cover transportation costs and school-
                        based activities. In the event a learning
                        experience is taken to a fee-based
                        destination, a learning experience
                        admission fee will be charged. </p>
