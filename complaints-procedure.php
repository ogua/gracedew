                        At GIS, we aim to partner with parents by
seeking parents’ views and encouraging
parents to participate in the decision-making process of the service. We
undertake to ensure all complaints are
taken seriously and dealt with fairly and
confidentially. We will endeavour to
quickly and informally resolve
complaints through discussion with the
parents and members of staff, as
appropriate. </p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">
Children will be made aware of the
complaints procedure in an age-appropriate manner. </p>

Procedure to Be Followed If a Parent/
Guardian Has a Complaint

<ul>

<li> If a parent/guardian is not satisfied
with any aspect of the School's service,
they should first seek to resolve the issue
informally by discussing it with
management. </li>

<li> If the issue is unresolved or reoccurs,
parents should put their complaint in
writing to Management. </li>

<li> The Governing Board may then
nominate one of its members to meet
with the parents and the Headmaster (as
appropriate) to try and resolve the issue.
This will be done at the earliest
opportunity. </li>

<li> If the issue remains unresolved, it may
be necessary for a third party to mediate
for the resolution of the complaint. </li>

<li> Written records of the discussion and
agreements made during this meeting
will be kept and copies made available to
parents, Headmaster or other involved
staff (as appropriate). </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">
GIS welcomes children’s and parents’
views on the development of the service.
Careful attention and a prompt and
courteous response will be given to any
suggestions, comments or complaints
thereby ensuring the development of a high-quality childcare service that meets
the needs of children and parents. An
early opportunity to highlight issues can
prevent problems from arising. Parents
are encouraged to try and resolve their
differences informally, through
discussion with management. </p>

<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">
If this is unsuccessful, the following
procedure must be followed: <br>

<b>Complaints Procedure </b> <br>

<ul>

<li> If you wish to make a complaint, you
should put it in writing to the School
Management who will try to resolve the
matter. </li>

<li> The Management Board will have a
disciplinary/complaints panel in place.
This panel will comprise the Chairperson
and two other members of the Board. </li>

<li> A written acknowledgment of the
complaint will be sent as soon as
possible. </li>

<li> If the complaint is related to the
behaviour of a member of staff, the staff
will be informed and given the full details
of the complaints made. </li>

<li> If required, a request may be made in
writing to the Board of Management to
have the complaint heard by a wider
group. This group could comprise of
disciplinary/ complaints panel plus an
external mediator. </li>

<li> Membership of this panel will not
comprise of any person directly involved
in the complaint or related to the
complainant, or staff member. </li>

<li> The person making the complaint may be accompanied by another person. </li>

<li> Following the request, a hearing
should be arranged within one month of
the lodging of the complainant. </li>

<li> An agreed written record of the
meeting will be kept by the external
mediator and, where appropriate, a
formal letter of the outcome will be
issued within a reasonable time
following the meeting. </li>

<li> In instances where the complaint
involves the welfare of a child/ children,

the information will be made known to
the relevant authorities and the full
Governing Board, through the
Chairperson. </li>

<li> Confidentiality is of the utmost
importance when dealing with
complaints. </li>

<li> All complaints will be dealt with at the
earliest opportunity. This will be no later
than the next Board meeting after a
complaint is made. </li>
