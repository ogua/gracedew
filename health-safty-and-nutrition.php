                        <b>Student Health and Illness Policy </b> <br>

                        It is the responsibility of the parent to
                        provide in writing any information related
                        to chronic health conditions or food
                        allergies. They are also required to
                        inform the school in writing of any
                        medical, physical, developmental or
                        emotional condition relevant to the
                        child's care. Ghana Education Service
                        regulations do not permit children to
                        attend school if sick. <br>

                        Children should be kept at, or taken
                        home if suffering from one or more of the
                        following conditions:
                        

                        <ul>
                            <li>An acute cold with fever, runny nose
                        and eyes, coughing and sore throat.
                        Once temperature, well-being, and
                        energy are normal, coughing and
                        runny nose may continue
                        (depending on the suspected
                        illness] without the child being
                        contagious and the child may return to the school.
                        If symptoms
                        are caused by a known allergic
                        reaction, then the child is not
                        contagious and may attend.</li>
                            <li> Breathing difficulty, wheezing or a
                            persistent cough. </li>

                            <li> Fever (38 degrees C or more)
                                accompanied by general symptoms
                                such as a sore throat or trouble
                                swallowing, infected skin or eyes,
                                or an undiagnosed rash, headache
                                and stiff neck, unexplained
                                diarrhoea, or loose stool, combined
                                with nausea, vomiting or
                                abdominal cramps, or severe
                            itching of body and scalp. </li>

                            <li> Children with known or suspected
                                communicable diseases. Should a
                                child develop any of the above
                                symptoms, staff will contact
                                parents/guardians and request
                                they pick up the child. Should a
                                child become sick with a
                                contagious disease,
                                parents/guardians must notify the
                                school within 24 hours so the staff
                                can inform other families. The sick
                                child should have a doctor's
                                approval in writing before returning
                                to the school if the illness was a
                                contagious disease. Ultimately, the
                                care of the child is the parent's
                            responsibility. </li>
